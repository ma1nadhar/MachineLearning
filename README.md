# Machine Learning
This repository serves as a showcase of the various machine-learning projects I have worked on. Within this repository, you will find a collection of projects that demonstrate my practical understanding of machine learning concepts, algorithms, and their applications. I have leveraged the power of data to uncover insights, build predictive models, and make informed decisions. These projects encompass a wide range of topics, including but not limited to: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Reinforcement Learning.
