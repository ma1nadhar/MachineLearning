# Machine Learning
This repository serves as a showcase of the various machine-learning projects I have worked on. Within this repository, you will find a collection of projects that demonstrate my practical understanding of machine learning concepts, algorithms, and their applications. I have leveraged the power of data to uncover insights, build predictive models, and make informed decisions. These projects encompass a wide range of topics, including but not limited to: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Reinforcement Learning.

### LinearRegression
   - Predict energy consumption using linear regression                                                                                                                
   - We use training data that has time in hours and corresponding energy consumption in kilowatt-hours

   - Train a linear regression model using sklearn linear regression class                                                                                                                                                                                 
   - Visualize the results by plotting the original data points along with the fitted regression lines or curves
